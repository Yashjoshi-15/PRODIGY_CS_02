# PRODIGY_CS_02

The described task was given by the Prodigy InfoTech as a part of educational internship. I recently embarked on building an image encryption tool using Python. This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using simple encryption techniques and offers the option to manipulate pixel values for added security.

# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
This Python script provides functionalities to encrypt and decrypt images using a simple encryption algorithm based on XOR operation. It also allows users to swap the RGB values of pixels in an image.

# OVERVIEW
- Encryption: Encrypts an image using a provided encryption key.

- Decryption: Decrypts an encrypted image using the corresponding decryption key.
 
- Pixel Swapping: Swaps the RGB values of pixels in an image.

- User Interaction: The script prompts the user to choose between encryption, decryption, pixel swapping, or exiting the program.
